# The Empire State Building Random Walk

## Problem Description

Imagine you and your friend have a dice, and you decide to embark on a fascinating adventure: climbing the Empire State Building, one step at a time. The rules are simple: If the dice shows 1 or 2, you take one step down. If it shows 3, 4, or 5, you take one step up. And if it's a 6, you get to roll the dice again and take that many steps up.

The question is, what are the odds of reaching a height of 60 steps on the Empire State Building by the time you're done with your journey?

## Overview

This Python project simulates this adventure and provides insights into the distribution of final positions after multiple random walks. We simulate the journey multiple times and analyze where our adventurers end up.

## Code Explanation

The code uses Python along with NumPy and Matplotlib for simulation and visualization. Here's a brief overview of how it works:
- Simulate random walks with the defined rules.
- Store the final positions of walkers.
- Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of final positions.
- Display the histogram to understand the odds of reaching 60 steps.

## Usage

You can run the code by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib) installed.
3. Execute the Python script.

## Results

The histogram generated by the code will show you the distribution of final positions, helping you answer the question of the odds of reaching 60 steps on the Empire State Building.
